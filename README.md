# pracCpointersFrmBooksWithGitHubCode
curated list of resources for studying C programming from books supplemented by GitHub code.
arranged during my stay in Leuven during Jan-Jul, 2017.
I decided to put all the resources(pdf, notes, links to authors on internet) on GitHub
so that it is easy for me to refer them while preparing for interviews.
